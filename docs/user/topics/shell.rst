==================
Command line shell
==================

Concert comes with a command line interface that is launched by typing
``concert`` into a shell. Several subcommands define the action of the tool.


Session commands
================

The ``concert`` tool is run from the command line.  Without any arguments, its
help is shown::

    $ concert
    usage: concert [-h] [--version]  ...

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help  show this help message and exit
      --version   show program's version number and exit

    Concert commands:

        init      Create a new session
        edit      Edit a session
        log       Show session logs
        show      Show available sessions or details of a given *session*
        mv        Move session *source* to *target*
        cp        Copy session *source* to *target*
        rm        Remove one or more sessions
        import    Import an existing *session*
        export    Export all sessions as a Zip archive
        start     Start a session
        docs      Create documentation of *session* docstring
        spyder    Start session using Spyder

The tool is command-driven, that means you call it with a command as its first
argument. To read command-specific help, use::

    $ concert [command] -h

.. note::

    When Concert is installed system-wide, a bash completion for the
    ``concert`` tool is installed too. This means, that commands and options
    will be completed when pressing the :kbd:`Tab` key.

.. _init-command:

init
----

.. program:: concert init

Create a new session with the given name::

    concert init experiment

If such a session already exists, Concert will warn you.

    .. option:: --force

        Create the session even if one already exists with this name.

    .. option:: --imports

        List of module names that are added to the import list.

.. note::

    The location of the session files depends on the chosen installation method.
    If you installed into a virtual environment ``venv``, the files will be
    stored in ``/path/to/venv/share/concert``. If you have installed Concert
    system-wide our without using a virtual environment, it is installed into
    ``$XDG_DATA_HOME/concert`` or ``$HOME/.local/share/concert`` if the former
    is not set. See the `XDG Base Directory Specification
    <https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html>`_
    for further information. It is probably a *very* good idea to put the
    session directory under version control.


.. _edit-command:

edit
----

.. program:: concert edit

Edit the session file by launching ``$EDITOR`` with the associated Python
module file::

    concert edit session-name

This file can contain any kind of Python code, but you will most likely just add
device definitions and import processes that you want to use in a session. If the
``session-name`` doesn't exist it is created.


log
---

.. program:: concert log

Show log of session::

    concert log session-name

If a session is not given, the log command shows entries from all sessions.

    .. option:: --follow

        Instead of showing the past log, update as changes come in. This is the
        same operation as if the log file was viewed with ``tail -f``.

By default, logs are gathered in ``$XDG_DATA_HOME/concert/concert.log``. To
change this, you can pass the ``--logto`` and ``--logfile`` options to the
``start`` command. For example, if you want to output log to ``stderr`` use ::

    concert start experiment --logto=stderr

or if you want to get rid of any log data use ::

    concert start experiment --logto=file --logfile=/dev/null

show
----

.. program:: concert show

Show all available sessions or details of a given session::

    concert show [session-name]


mv
--

.. program:: concert mv

Rename a session::

    concert mv old-session new-session


cp
--

.. program:: concert cp

Copy a session::

    concert cp session session-copy


rm
--

.. program:: concert rm

Remove one or more sessions::

    concert rm session-1 session-2

.. warning::

    Be careful. The session file is unlinked from the file system and no
    backup is made.


.. _import-command:

import
------

.. program:: concert import

Import an existing session from a Python file::

    concert import some-session.py

Concert will warn you if you try to import a session with a name that already
exists.

    .. option:: --force

        Overwrite session if it already exists.

    .. option:: --repo

        The URL denotes a Git repository from which the sessions are imported.

.. warning::

    The server certificates are *not* verified when specifying an HTTPS
    connection!


.. _export-command:

export
------

.. program:: concert export

Export all sessions as a Zip archive::

    concert export foobar

Creates a Zip archive named *foobar.zip* containing all sessions.


.. _start-command:

start
-----

.. program:: concert start

Load the session file and launch an IPython shell::

    concert start session-name

The quantities package is already loaded and named ``q``.

    .. option:: --logto={stderr, file}

        Specify a method for logging events. If this flag is not specified,
        ``file`` is used and assumed to be
        ``$XDG_DATA_HOME/concert/concert.log``.

    .. option:: --logfile=<filename>

        Specify a log file if ``--logto`` is set to ``file``.

    .. option:: --loglevel={debug, info, warning, error, critical}

        Specify lowest log level that is logged.

    .. cmdoption:: --non-interactive

        Run the session as a script and do not launch a shell.

    .. option:: --filename=<filename>

        Start a session from a file without initializing.

.. note::

    You may use the ``await`` keyword in session files and the sesion will be
    loaded correctly, for details see Importing_.


docs
----

.. program:: concert docs

Create a PDF documentation for a session::

    concert docs session-name

Creates a PDF manual named *session-name.zip* with the contents taken from the
session's docstring. The docstring should be formatted in Markdown markup.

.. note::

    This requires an installation of `Pandoc`_ and `PDFLaTeX`_.

.. _shell-importing:

Importing
=========

When you import a module or a session, before anything else, concert first looks
into the sessions directory. If the module is not found, it looks into the
current working directory and if it is not found even there it searches in
``sys.path``, where all the standard paths are stored.

Concert can run sessions with top-level ``await`` (outside ``async def``
functions). Sessions can also import such modules into them and even nest such
imports. There are two limitations to this:

- if you have a top-level ``await`` in a module, you cannot use the asyncio's
  loop, e.g. by concert's ``run_in_loop`` function
- you cannot import modules with top-level ``await`` inside functions, you need
  to put the imports to the top level


For example, this is possible (session ``motors``)::

    from concert.devices.motors.dummy import LinearMotor

    motor = await LinearMotor()


and this is possible::

    from motors import motor
    from concert.quantities import q

    await motor.set_position(1 * q.mm)


On the other hand, this is *not* possible::

    async def foo():
        import motors  # The example session above

    await foo()


and this is *not* possible::

    from concert.coroutines.base import run_in_loop
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    run_in_loop(asyncio.sleep(1))



Remote access
=============

Concert comes with two shell scripts that leverage the terminal multiplexer
tmux_ and the secure shell protocol. Thus you *must* have installed and started
an OpenSSH server as well as the relevant ports opened.

To start a Concert session server run::

    concert-server <session-name>

This starts a new tmux session which you can *detach* from by typing Ctrl-B. On
a client machine you can connect to the server and tmux session by running::

    concert-connect <host address>

.. _tmux: https://tmux.github.io/


Extensions
==========

Spyder
------

.. program:: concert spyder

If Spyder_ is installed, start the session within the Spyder GUI::

    concert spyder <session-name>

In Spyder you can for example edit the session, check the documentation or run an IPython console or a Python interpreter:
